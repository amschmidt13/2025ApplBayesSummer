This folder contains the analysis of the rainfall Parana dataset which is available from the [geoR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geoR/index.html) 
package in R. 
We also use this dataset to perform  an approximation of the GP using the NNGP of Datta et al. (2016). 
These codes were provided by [Dr Paritosh K. Roy](https://github.com/paritoshkroy).
